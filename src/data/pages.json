      "desc": "Today, I participated in my Dance Capstone Symposium: a collection of interdisciplinary dance research projects from over 20 dance minors @ UD! I am tremendously proud to share the completion of my research: Computationally Random Choreography. I am tremendously proud of myself and my work as this integrated all important components to my life: computing, dance, and (original!) music. I have included the Abstract to the paper below, along with the project link, with more information. I encourage you to read the paper.\n\n\n[Final Paper](/file?src=CRC.pdf)\n\n\nABSTRACT: Often considered divergent disciplines, computer science and dance share limited intellectual crossover in research and literature. Where work exists, the resources are often unidirectional; dance will support or frame the computer science-driven investigation, and rarely be reversed. Under these constraints, the implications of computer science in a dance (creative) environment are not adequately covered. This study investigates the gap between creative ambiguity and computational determinism. I propose two choreographed performances and a collection of interpreted results from a 10-person pilot study. The first performance features original choreography prepared for film, accompanied by original (non-movement-influential) music. The second performance, known as a Computationally Random Choreography (CRC), was created by a Bash script with FFmpeg software to shuffle the frames of the original performance; code excerpts are available in the Appendix. The randomized sequence was interpreted and performed on film with another original musical accompaniment. A pilot study analyzing the interpretation and perception of both videos revealed insight into computational perception and artistic intent. Surprisingly, the randomized choreography did not hinder emotional resonance—participants often described the CRC as expressive, deliberate, and even more emotionally complex than the original. These findings suggest that randomness, when interpreted through human movement, can generate compelling artistic outcomes and challenge assumptions about authorship, creativity, and meaning in dance. Moreover, the integration of creative ambition into computer science development and education is essential, fostering interdisciplinary innovation and redefining how we perceive both artistic and computational possibility.

From hacking in past years to recruiting, organizing, managing, training, and hiring volunteers, I’ve experienced an indescribable whirlwind of excitement, challenge, and intensity. \n\nI don’t believe I can translate the emotions of this experience into words—let alone a Highlight post. I don't believe I can convince you of the energy, the camaraderie, or the sheer love that fueled this team. I don't believe that it’s over. \n\nBut I do believe, and I can say with absolute certainty, that we built something incredible: I believe we made the most unforgettable, innovative, and well-executed CIS hackathon to date.\n\nI’d revel in my emotions and pour my heart onto this screen to share the overwhelming love this event has left me with—but I’d miss the feeling too much to let it go. So instead, I’ll share the stats that mean the most to me and express my deepest gratitude to those who made HenHacks 2025 possible.\n\nIn one weekend, we had\n---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- ---- \n| $11.5K in prizes awarded to our winners 🏆 \n| Nearly 500 participants! 🫂 \n| FIFTY-THREE UNIVERSITIES 🤯 \n| one ripped pants 👖 \n\nTo all the interns, and especially to my very own Volunteering Committee Intern, and my newfound friend, Rebecca Forman, thank you -- you all inspire me to be better.\n\nTo my fellow committee heads and new friends, thank you. Your trust, leadership, and unwavering support convinced me to believe—in this event, in this team, and in myself.\n\nTo my admins—Ella Wilkins, Giovanna Scozzaro, Nazim Karaca, and Debra Yarrington—your courage, transparency, and relentless dedication pushed this hackathon to its fullest potential. None of this would have been possible without you.\n\nTo my internship at Berkley Technology Services, your commitment and sponsorship elevated HenHacks 2025 to new heights. Your support didn't just fuel this event—it fueled innovation, collaboration, and an unforgettable experience for all. Thank you.\n\nFinally, thank you HenHacks. 🩷\n\n[Website](https://www.henhackshackathon.com/)\n[UDaily Article](https://www.udel.edu/udaily/2025/june/computer-science-students-organize-henhacks-hackathon/)",
